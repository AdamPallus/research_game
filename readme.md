# The Research Game

## Your Tasks

- With your degree in hand (or almost!) it's time to look for a job! Submit a research proposal for review by the faculty. 
- Choose any topic you like! If the committee does not accept your proposal, they'll usually give you tips on how to improve -- as long as you dont offend them!

## Do the Research!
At first you have no funding and must support yourself through teaching. When research funding opportunities arise, pick one that appeals to you. Opportunities vary in duration, chance of funding and the funding amounts, depending on the topic and relevance to your funding agencies
